I^[If you want to know more about me here is my
[CV](https://github.com/mbataillou/cv/blob/a14a6127f29cd2b0f0070107b8a2c446018bd985/short-academic/cv-short-mbataillou.pdf)
and my [GitHub](https://github.com/mbataillou).] have been working as an
_Applied Scientist_ since 2019. First, focusing on machine-learning based
forecasting models, and now focusing on _large scale_ network optimization
solutions. I am deeply grateful to those who share their knowledge online, as I
have learned so much from them. I hope that Computational Loops can also
contribute to helping others in the community.
