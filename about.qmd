been working as an _Applied Scientist_ since 2019. First, focusing on
machine-learning based forecasting models, and now focusing on _large scale_
network optimization solutions. I am deeply grateful to those who share their
knowledge online, as I have learned so much from them. I hope that Computational
Loops can also contribute to helping others in the community.
