[CV](https://nightly.link/mbataillou/cv/workflows/makefile/main/cv-short-mbataillou)
and my [GitHub](https://github.com/mbataillou).] have been working as an
_Applied Scientist_ since 2019. First, focusing on machine-learning based
forecasting models, and now focusing on _large scale_ network optimization
solutions. I am deeply grateful to those who share their knowledge online, as I
have learned so much from them. I hope that Computational Loops can also
contribute to helping others in the community.
